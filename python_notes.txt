(1)Python has no notion of main() function or method.There is no notion of edir-complie-link-run process too.Python has interpreter and no notion of executable like .class.
(2)IDLE is built-in Python IDE.Allu need is to type in ur code,save it and then press F5 to run it.
(3) functions + modules = The Standard Library ,Python comes with a powerful standarad library which provides access to lots of reusabale modules(e.g. datetime etc.) Python Standard Library isn't the only place u'll find excellent importable modules to use with your code.The Python community also supports a thriving collection of 3rd party modules.
(4)Lists in Python can conatin any data of any type,and u can even mix the types of data in a list
(5) The type of variable doesn't need to be declared when u assign a value to a variable in Python,it dynamically takes on the type of the data it refers to.
(6) u make decisions with the if/elif/else statement.The if,elif and else keywords precede blocks of code which are known in the Python world as "suites"
(7) It is easy to spot suites of code as they are always indented.Indentation is the only code grouping mechanism provided by Python.
(8) In addition to indentation,suites of code are also preceded by a colon(:).This is a syntactical requirement of the language.
(9) u can import a specific function from a module.For example, "from time import sleep".imports the sleep function, letting you invoke it without qualification.
(10)if u simply import a module-for example, "import time"-u then need to qualify the usage of any of the module's functions with the module name.like so: time.sleep().
(11) ** is used to calculate the exponential value also **=
(12) Itendity Operators-- is,is not e.g. type(2) is int is True
(13) Membership Operators -- in,not in e.g "Hello" in "Hello Goodbye" is True
(14) Python lacks a switch staement but the if..elif staement is generally used for the same purpose in Python.
